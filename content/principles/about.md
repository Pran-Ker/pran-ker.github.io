# About Me

*Journey | Experience*

## Prannay ✧

I have the tendency to be overly critical of myself, this sometimes comes across as lack confidence. However this is far from the truth. A simple way of credit assignment for progress is  the story of recent years:

It is the end of college, and I had the choice of a well paying job in Boston (Virtusa), which had exceptional pay. But the interviews were too easy, so I told my parents I was going to reject it with no backups and find something better. A few months later, I got into a bouquet consulting firm and was soon leading an entire team while reporting to multiple clients (Bread Financials, California Lawyers of Arts, etc).

## Moving to Dallas

One day, I was informed that I had to move to Dallas to fill a vacancy in a month. Packed my things and with a bit of cash from my mom and a forex card from my dad (I had no savings at this point). I had to figure everything from stay to cooking to getting licenses on my own in the US (which is relatively difficult for a 22 year old).

## San Francisco

Work was hectic, but I wanted more growth and Dallas isn't the place for someone ambitious. I set the deadline as to move at the time of Codex - Stanford Hackathon, and moved my things into a Uhaul and started staying in hostels in San Francisco. I would start work at 5 AM (East Coast clients) and end at 4 PM, after which I would attend all the tech or startup events I could.

## Stanford

I applied to study at Stanford. Not for a Masters, I couldn't afford to spend two years, so I applied for the semester program. This is obviously easier to get into than a few other programs and is easy to dismiss, but it still requires incredible credentials to get into. And if it was that easy everyone would do!

The time I spent in Palo Alto was some of the best months, super tough classes (HPC, Convex Optimization..) and incredibly smart and ambitious peers. Course assignments included running simulations of proteins on HPCs to solving optimization problems for rocket propulsions. On days I had time I would also sneak into MBA classes and astrophysics classes because they interested me.

## Business

All this time, I was still working though it was getting stale. Our company had just been acquired and a lot of coworkers were leaving. And I was growing restless again, I needed to build something. The startup route seemed too crowded and non-contrarian, so I instead committed to follow the play book of "Buy then Build", despite the friends and family cautioning me against this path.

I spent the next 6 months doing due diligence on different Franchises which I could acquire with my current savings. I spoke to different franchises, their owners, local businessmen and consultants, and slowly arrived at my thesis of building the business. I signed the FDD on "Mister Sparky", a residential electrician servicing business based in Palo Alto.

After I had settled the lease, purchased the equipment, hired a master electrician, got a service man, and started the process of getting an SBA loan, I started seeing cracks in the business. Two months in I realised that the projected starting capital did not account for Bay Area rates and some of the licenses would get dragged out. Something which I wouldn't be willing to cover with borrowing from friends and family (I had spent 90% of my savings at this point). I chose to cut my losses and cancelled the SBA loan. This is my post mortem of my learning from running the business.

## AGI Inc

Instead of joining a company immediately, I contracted for a couple of companies (Yellowpad - built by a Stanford Law graduate, etc). On the side while participating in hackathons, I was scouted by AGI Inc. Started by Stanford PhD working on implementing GRPO for improving Agents. This was a research + engineering position, and had some of the smartest people I have met (and I have met a lot at this point).

These are some of the learnings from my time at AGI Inc.
