# Research Excellence Through Rigor

*Core Principle #1*

## The Foundation of Good Science

Quality research isn't just about having the right ideas—it's about executing them with rigor and honesty. This principle guides everything I do, from experimental design to result reporting.

## What This Means in Practice

### Systematic Evaluation
Every claim needs evidence. Every benchmark needs proper baselines. Every improvement needs statistical significance testing. I believe in:

- **Reproducible experiments** with clear methodology
- **Multiple random seeds** and proper error bars
- **Fair comparisons** against strong baselines
- **Open sharing** of code and data when possible

### Honest Reporting
The pressure to publish can tempt researchers to oversell results or hide limitations. I commit to:

- Reporting negative results when they're informative
- Being transparent about what doesn't work
- Acknowledging limitations upfront
- Sharing failed experiments that might help others

### Building on Solid Foundations
Great research builds incrementally on previous work. This means:

- **Thorough literature reviews** to understand what's been tried
- **Proper attribution** to previous contributions
- **Clear positioning** of how new work advances the field
- **Collaborative spirit** rather than competitive secrecy

## Why This Matters

In a field moving as fast as AI, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and rush to publish. But shortcuts in rigor hurt the entire field:

- Invalid results waste everyone's time
- Irreproducible work slows down progress  
- Overstated claims erode public trust
- Poor baselines make it hard to measure real progress

## Examples from My Work

When I developed the WebArena benchmark, I insisted on:
- Testing across multiple domains (not just one)
- Including both simple and complex tasks
- Comparing against multiple baseline approaches
- Open-sourcing everything for community validation

This rigorous approach meant more work upfront, but it resulted in a benchmark the community could trust and build upon.

## The Long-Term View

Research excellence isn't about individual papers—it's about contributing to a cumulative understanding that serves humanity. Each rigorous study, even if small, adds a reliable brick to the foundation of human knowledge.

*Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.*
