## The Books That Shaped Me

These aren't just books I enjoyed—these are books that fundamentally changed how I think about AI, research, and building technology. Each one offers something unique that I still reference today.

## Technical Foundation

### "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
**Why it matters:** This is the book that taught me to think rigorously about machine learning. Every technique is explained from first principles with mathematical precision.

**Key insight:** Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff isn't just academic—it's essential for building systems that work in the real world.

### "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop
**Why it matters:** Bishop's approach to probabilistic thinking transformed how I approach uncertainty in AI systems.

**Key insight:** Everything in ML is about managing uncertainty. Bayesian thinking provides the right framework.

## Research Philosophy

### "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn
**Why it matters:** Kuhn's concept of paradigm shifts helped me understand how fields evolve and when to question fundamental assumptions.

**Key insight:** Normal science advances incrementally, but breakthroughs come from questioning the paradigm itself.

### "Against Method" by Paul Feyerabend
**Why it matters:** A provocative argument that scientific progress doesn't follow rigid rules. Sometimes you need to break methodology to make breakthroughs.

**Key insight:** Creativity and opportunism are as important as rigor in research.

## Systems Thinking

### "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman
**Why it matters:** Understanding cognitive biases is crucial when designing AI systems and interpreting experimental results.

**Key insight:** Our intuitions about intelligence and decision-making are often wrong. Design for System 1 vs System 2 thinking.

### "The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman
**Why it matters:** User-centered design principles apply to AI systems too. If users can't understand or control an AI system, it's not truly useful.

**Key insight:** Good design is invisible. AI should augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment.

## Recent Discoveries

### "Noise" by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein
**Why it matters:** Most discussions of AI bias focus on systematic errors, but random variability (noise) is often a bigger problem.

**Key insight:** Reducing noise is often more impactful than correcting bias.

### "The Alignment Problem" by Brian Christian
**Why it matters:** The best accessible introduction to AI safety research. Helped me think more clearly about the long-term implications of AI development.

**Key insight:** Alignment isn't just a technical problem—it's about values, ethics, and what kind of future we want.

## Philosophy and Ethics

### "Superintelligence" by Nick Bostrom
**Why it matters:** Even if you disagree with Bostrom's timeline, the book forces you to think seriously about the long-term consequences of AI research.

**Key insight:** The transition to superintelligence might be the most important event in human history. We should think carefully about it.

### "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Neil
**Why it matters:** A wake-up call about how algorithmic systems can perpetuate and amplify social inequalities.

**Key insight:** Technical neutrality is a myth. Every algorithm embodies values and assumptions.

## Currently Reading

I'm always working through new books. Current stack includes:
- "The Righteous Mind" by Jonathan Haidt (moral psychology)
- "Complexity: A Guided Tour" by Melanie Mitchell (complexity science)
- "Human Compatible" by Stuart Russell (AI safety)

## How I Read

**For technical books:** I read slowly, work through examples, and maintain a notebook of key insights.

**For philosophy/general books:** I read for perspective rather than completeness. Sometimes a single chapter changes how I think about everything.

**For staying current:** I skim many recent papers and books, but only dive deep into ones that seem to offer genuinely new insights.
